## Implementation Details

### 1. Demo Context (`app/contexts/DemoContext.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Central state management for demo mode
- **Features**:
  - Role state management (customer, dispatcher, driver, admin)
  - Driver ID selection and persistence
  - localStorage integration for state persistence
  - Automatic navigation based on role
  - Demo mode cookie for middleware
- **Exports**:
  - `DemoProvider` - Context provider component
  - `useDemo()` - Hook for accessing demo context
  - `DemoRole` type - TypeScript type for roles

### 2. Demo Role Switcher (`app/components/demo/DemoRoleSwitcher.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: UI widget for switching roles and managing demo state
- **Features**:
  - Floating widget (bottom-right, z-index: 40)
  - Warning banner (top, z-index: 50)
  - Role selector dropdown with icons
  - Driver selector (visible when driver role selected)
  - Quick Actions menu with demo flows
  - Expand/collapse functionality
  - Smooth animations (300ms transitions)
- **Role Icons**:
  - Customer: User icon (blue)
  - Dispatcher: Package icon (purple)
  - Driver: Truck icon (green)
  - Admin: Shield icon (orange)

### 3. Demo Auth Hook (`app/hooks/useDemoAuth.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides demo user data based on current role
- **Features**:
  - Returns null when not in demo mode
  - Generates appropriate demo user based on role
  - Maps driver IDs to driver names
  - Compatible with existing auth patterns

### 4. Demo Data (`app/lib/demo/demoData.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Generate realistic test data
- **Features**:
  - 5 NYC sample addresses with distances
  - 5 demo customers with contact info
  - Pricing calculation (base + per mile + fuel surcharge)
  - `generateDemoOrders()` - Creates 5 orders with various statuses
  - `createTestOrder()` - Creates single test order
- **Order Statuses**: ReadyForDispatch (2), Assigned (1), PickedUp (1), Delivered (1)

### 5. Client Layout (`app/components/ClientLayout.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Wraps app with demo provider
- **Integration**: Renders DemoProvider and DemoRoleSwitcher for all pages

## How It Works

### Demo Mode Activation
1. Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`
2. Restart development server
3. Demo mode automatically activates (no auth required)

### Role Switching Flow
1. User selects role from dropdown
2. `setRole()` called in DemoContext
3. Role saved to localStorage
4. Router navigates to appropriate page
5. Demo cookie set for middleware
6. Page renders with demo user data

### State Persistence
- **localStorage keys**:
  - `demo-role`: Current role (customer|dispatcher|driver|admin)
  - `demo-driver-id`: Selected driver ID (when driver role)
  - `demo-test-orders`: Created test orders array
- State restored on page load
- Survives page refreshes
- Cleared on "Reset All Demo Data"

### Quick Action Flows
1. **Start as Customer â†’ Quote**: Sets customer role, navigates to /quote
2. **View as Dispatcher â†’ Assign**: Sets dispatcher role, navigates to /dispatcher
3. **View as Driver â†’ Update Status**: Sets driver role, auto-selects driver, navigates to /driver
4. **View as Admin â†’ Manage**: Sets admin role, navigates to /admin

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` âœ… (Done)
2. Set demo mode: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`
3. Start server: `npm run dev`

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Verify yellow banner at top
3. Verify floating widget in bottom-right
4. Test switching between all 4 roles
5. Test driver selection (when driver role)
6. Test quick actions (Create Order, Reset Data)
7. Refresh page and verify state persists
8. Check browser console for errors

### Full Test (15 minutes)
See `DEMO_TEST_PLAN.md` for comprehensive checklist

## Server Status

**Current Status**: Server started, responding with HTTP 500  
**Likely Cause**: Missing environment variables (Supabase credentials)

### To Complete Manual Testing

Option 1: **Add minimal environment variables**
```bash
# Create .env.local with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://placeholder.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=placeholder_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=placeholder_key
```

Option 2: **Test with existing .env.local**
```bash
# Add to your existing .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
```

Then restart:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true npm run dev
```
