## Manual Testing Guide

To complete the testing, follow these steps for manual verification:

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

```bash
# Set demo mode and start the server
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true npm run dev
```

Wait for the server to start (usually at http://localhost:3000)

### Step 2: Visual Verification

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and verify:

1. **Demo Mode Banner** (Top of page)
   - [ ] Yellow warning banner appears
   - [ ] Shows: "⚠ DEMO MODE - This is for testing only. Data shown is not real. ⚠"
   - [ ] Fixed to top of viewport
   - [ ] Visible on all pages

2. **Demo Mode Widget** (Bottom-right corner)
   - [ ] Floating widget visible
   - [ ] Shows current role with icon
   - [ ] Can expand/collapse with chevron button
   - [ ] Smooth animations

### Step 3: Test Role Switching

#### Customer Role
- [ ] Select "Customer" from dropdown
- [ ] Icon changes to User icon (blue background)
- [ ] Navigates to home page (/)
- [ ] Widget shows "Current: Customer"

#### Dispatcher Role
- [ ] Select "Dispatcher" from dropdown
- [ ] Icon changes to Package icon (purple background)
- [ ] Navigates to /dispatcher
- [ ] Widget shows "Current: Dispatcher"

#### Driver Role
- [ ] Select "Driver" from dropdown
- [ ] Icon changes to Truck icon (green background)
- [ ] Driver selector dropdown appears
- [ ] Select "John Smith (Demo)"
- [ ] Navigates to /driver
- [ ] Widget shows "Current: Driver" and "Driver: demo-driver-1"
- [ ] Change to "Sarah Johnson (Demo)" - verify it updates
- [ ] Change to "Mike Davis (Demo)" - verify it updates

#### Admin Role
- [ ] Select "Admin" from dropdown
- [ ] Icon changes to Shield icon (orange background)
- [ ] Navigates to /admin
- [ ] Widget shows "Current: Admin"

### Step 4: Test Quick Actions

Expand "Quick Actions" menu and test:

#### Demo Flows
- [ ] Click "1. Start as Customer → Quote"
  - Switches to customer role
  - Navigates to /quote page
  
- [ ] Click "2. View as Dispatcher → Assign"
  - Switches to dispatcher role
  - Navigates to /dispatcher page
  
- [ ] Click "3. View as Driver → Update Status"
  - Switches to driver role
  - Auto-selects demo-driver-1 if none selected
  - Navigates to /driver page
  
- [ ] Click "4. View as Admin → Manage"
  - Switches to admin role
  - Navigates to /admin page

#### Data Actions
- [ ] Click "Create Test Order"
  - Page reloads
  - Check localStorage: should have entry in 'demo-test-orders'
  - New order should appear in relevant views
  
- [ ] Click "Reset All Demo Data"
  - Page reloads
  - localStorage is cleared
  - All demo data reset to initial state

### Step 5: Test State Persistence

- [ ] Switch to "Dispatcher" role
- [ ] Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- [ ] Verify still in Dispatcher role after reload
- [ ] Switch to "Driver" and select "Sarah Johnson"
- [ ] Refresh the page
- [ ] Verify still in Driver role with Sarah Johnson selected

### Step 6: Test on Multiple Pages

Navigate to different pages while in demo mode:
- [ ] Home (/)
- [ ] Quote (/quote)
- [ ] Dispatcher (/dispatcher)
- [ ] Driver (/driver)
- [ ] Admin (/admin)
- [ ] Customer Dashboard (/customer/dashboard)

Verify on each page:
- Banner is visible at top
- Widget is visible in bottom-right
- Can switch roles from any page

### Step 7: Test Widget Interactions

- [ ] Click chevron to collapse widget - verify it minimizes
- [ ] Click chevron again to expand - verify it opens
- [ ] Click Quick Actions to open menu - verify it expands
- [ ] Click Quick Actions again - verify it collapses
- [ ] Hover over buttons - verify hover states work
- [ ] All dropdowns open/close smoothly

### Step 8: Browser Console Check

Open browser developer tools (F12) and check:
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] No React warnings
- [ ] No network errors
- [ ] localStorage entries are being set correctly:
  - `demo-role`: should contain current role
  - `demo-driver-id`: should contain selected driver (when driver role)
  - `demo-test-orders`: should contain created test orders

### Step 9: Test Demo Mode Disabled

1. Stop the development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start without demo mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   (or set NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false)
3. Verify:
   - [ ] No demo banner appears
   - [ ] No demo widget appears
   - [ ] Normal authentication is required

### Step 10: Browser Compatibility (Optional)

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

## Expected Behavior

### What Should Work:
✅ Role switching without authentication  
✅ Navigation to role-specific pages  
✅ State persistence across page refreshes  
✅ Create and manage demo orders  
✅ Quick action flows  
✅ UI interactions (expand/collapse, dropdowns)  
✅ localStorage data management  

### Known Limitations (Expected):
⚠️ Data resets on localStorage clear  
⚠️ No real database operations  
⚠️ No actual emails sent  
⚠️ No real payment processing  
⚠️ Demo mode should NEVER be enabled in production

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Demo banner/widget not appearing
**Solution**: 
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` is set
- Clear browser cache
- Restart development server
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Role switching not working
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear localStorage and try again

### Issue: Navigation not happening
**Solution**:
- Ensure Next.js router is initialized
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify routes exist in the app

### Issue: Driver selection not persisting
**Solution**:
- Check localStorage for `demo-driver-id` key
- Verify driver role is selected
- Clear localStorage and try again

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete manual testing checklist above
2. Document any issues found
3. Test the complete workflow:
   - Customer creates quote → Dispatcher assigns → Driver delivers → Admin reviews
4. Verify demo data appears correctly in each role's view
5. Test rapid role switching to check for race conditions
6. Verify UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
