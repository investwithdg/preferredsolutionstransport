# Updates Summary - October 2, 2025

## üìù Files Updated

### 1. `env.example` ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Recommended for production deployments
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - Used for Stripe redirect URLs
- Added clarifying comments about `VERCEL_URL` (auto-set, don't manually configure)
- Added warning that `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is REQUIRED for quote form

**Why:** Your Vercel deployment appears blank because the quote page waits for Google Maps to load, and without the API key, it never loads.

### 2. `supabase/consolidated-schema.sql` ‚úÖ
**Added ~306 lines (now 692 total):**

**New Tables:**
- `public.users` - Role-based access control (admin, dispatcher, driver, recipient)
- `public.api_rate_limits` - Database-backed rate limiting

**New Functions:**
- `current_user_role()` - Get authenticated user's role
- `is_admin_or_dispatcher()` - Permission helper
- `check_rate_limit()` - Rate limiting logic (fixed variable collision bug)
- `cleanup_rate_limits()` - Maintenance function
- `get_system_health()` - Monitoring metrics
- `get_system_alerts()` - Issue detection

**Enhanced Security:**
- Role-based RLS policies for all tables
- Admin/dispatcher full access to operational tables
- Driver restrictions (only see/update assigned orders)
- Recipient restrictions (only see their own orders/events)
- Added `auth_email` column to customers for recipient mapping

**Production Hardening:**
- Data quality constraints (positive distances, prices, weights)
- Performance indexes for common queries
- Partial indexes for active orders and quotes
- Stripe session lookup indexes

**Why:** Your middleware and rate-limit code expect these tables and functions. Without them, authenticated routes and rate limiting would fail.

### 3. `supabase/migrations/20250826170806_milestone_2_drivers.sql` ‚úÖ
**Fixed:**
- Resolved merge conflict (removed `<<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>` markers)
- Kept all migration content intact

### 4. `VERCEL_ENV_CHECKLIST.md` ‚úÖ (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for adding environment variables to Vercel

**Covers:**
- Critical variables (app won't work without these)
- Recommended variables (improves functionality)
- Optional variables (enhances features)
- Variables NOT to set (auto-injected by Vercel)
- Troubleshooting common deployment issues
- Testing checklist after deployment

### 5. `SUPABASE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` ‚úÖ (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:** Complete guide for applying the schema update

**Covers:**
- What's being added in 2.5
- Step-by-step update process (fresh setup vs. incremental)
- Verification queries to confirm success
- How to set up user roles and permissions
- Testing queries for each role type
- Common issues and solutions
- Backward compatibility notes

## üéØ Your Questions - Answered

### 1. ‚úÖ Environment Variable Discrepancies

**Problem:** Confusion about which env vars are actually needed and how Vercel handles them.

**Solution:**
- Updated `env.example` with clear sections and comments
- Created `VERCEL_ENV_CHECKLIST.md` with complete guide
- Key insight: `VERCEL_URL` is auto-set by Vercel (don't manually add it)
- Critical missing var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (causes blank quote page)

**Action Required:**
1. Copy ALL vars from your `.env.local` to Vercel dashboard
2. Especially: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, Supabase keys, Stripe keys
3. Optionally add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

### 2. ‚úÖ Sentry.io - Do You Need It?

**Answer:** No, it's completely optional.

**What it is:** Error tracking and performance monitoring service.

**How it works in your code:**
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is not set, Sentry never initializes
- All capture functions become no-ops (safe to call, do nothing)
- Package is `optionalDependencies` in `package.json`

**Recommendation:** Skip it for now. Add it later if you want production error monitoring.

### 3. ‚úÖ Vercel Not Deploying the Interface

**Root Cause:** Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in Vercel.

**Why:** 
- Your quote page (`app/quote/page.tsx`) uses `useLoadScript` from `@react-google-maps/api`
- It waits for the Google Maps library to load before showing the form
- Without the API key, it stays stuck on "Loading Google Maps..."
- This makes the entire app appear "blank" or "not working"

**Solution:**
1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to Vercel (use the same value from your `.env.local`)
2. Redeploy (Vercel will auto-deploy when you add the var, or manually trigger)
3. Test by visiting `your-domain.com/quote` - should now show the form

**Additional Checks:**
- Visit `/api/health` to verify all services are connected
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify all env vars are set (see `VERCEL_ENV_CHECKLIST.md`)

### 4. ‚úÖ Consolidated Schema Needs 2.5 Updates

**Problem:** Schema was at Milestone 2.0, but your code expects 2.5 features (roles, rate limiting).

**Solution:** 
- Updated `consolidated-schema.sql` with all 2.5 additions
- Safe to re-run (uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `DROP IF EXISTS`)
- Preserves existing data

**What was added:**
- User roles and authentication
- Rate limiting infrastructure  
- Production constraints and indexes
- Monitoring functions

**Action Required:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `supabase/consolidated-schema.sql`
3. Paste and run
4. Verify success (see `SUPABASE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`)

## üîç No Changes Needed For

These files are already correctly configured:

- ‚úÖ `lib/sentry.ts` - Already optional, no changes needed
- ‚úÖ `lib/rate-limit.ts` - Already uses DB function, no changes needed
- ‚úÖ `lib/hubspot/*` - Already has env fallbacks, no changes needed
- ‚úÖ `middleware.ts` - Already expects users table, no changes needed
- ‚úÖ `app/api/**/*.ts` - All API routes correctly configured
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` - Deployment config is correct
- ‚úÖ `next.config.js` - No changes needed
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Dependencies correct

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Why your Vercel deploy looked blank:** Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` caused quote page to hang on "Loading Google Maps..."

2. **Why Sentry isn't an issue:** It's optional and doesn't initialize without the DSN. Safe to ignore.

3. **Why schema needed updating:** Your code (middleware, rate-limiting) expects tables and functions that weren't in the old schema.

4. **Why VERCEL_URL confusion:** Vercel auto-injects this at runtime. You don't set it manually, but your code can reference it for fallback URLs.

5. **Why .env.local doesn't transfer to Vercel:** It's gitignored for security. You must manually add each var in Vercel dashboard.

### Deployment Issues  
- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify all env vars are set
- Test `/api/health` endpoint
- Check browser console for client errors

### Payment Issues
