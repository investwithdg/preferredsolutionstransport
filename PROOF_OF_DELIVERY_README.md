## Overview

A comprehensive proof of delivery (PoD) system has been implemented, allowing drivers to capture photos and digital signatures when completing deliveries. This document outlines the implementation, setup, and usage.

## Features

- **Photo Capture**: Up to 3 photos per delivery using device camera or file upload
- **Digital Signature**: Touch/mouse-based signature pad
- **Delivery Notes**: Optional text notes for additional delivery information
- **Recipient Tracking**: Record the name of the person who received the delivery
- **Automatic Compression**: Photos are automatically compressed to reduce storage size
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in private Supabase Storage bucket with RLS policies
- **HubSpot Integration**: PoD data synced to HubSpot deals

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Migration

Execute the migration file to create the necessary database structure:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or apply directly in Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy and paste contents of: supabase/migrations/005_add_proof_of_delivery.sql
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

In Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Create a new bucket**
2. Name: `proof-of-delivery`
3. **Public**: ‚ùå (Keep private)
4. Click **Create bucket**

The RLS policies are automatically created by the migration.

### 3. Verify Setup

Check that the following exist:

- ‚úÖ Table: `delivery_proof`
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket: `proof-of-delivery`
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on `delivery_proof` table
- ‚úÖ Storage policies for authenticated access

## Usage

### Utilities

```
lib/proof-of-delivery/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ capture.ts                     # Camera, photo, signature utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ storage.ts                     # Supabase Storage operations
```

```
app/api/orders/[orderId]/proof-of-delivery/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts                       # POST: Submit PoD, GET: Retrieve PoD
```

### Database

```
supabase/migrations/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 005_add_proof_of_delivery.sql  # Database schema and policies
```

## API Reference

### POST /api/orders/[orderId]/proof-of-delivery

Submit proof of delivery for an order.

**Request Body** (FormData):

- `photo_0`, `photo_1`, `photo_2`: Photo files (optional, max 3)
- `signature`: Signature image file (optional)
- `notes`: Delivery notes (optional)
- `recipientName`: Name of recipient (required)

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pod": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "photoUrls": ["url1", "url2"],
    "signatureUrl": "url"
  }
}
```

### GET /api/orders/[orderId]/proof-of-delivery

Retrieve proof of delivery for an order.

**Response**:

    "signature_url": "signed_url",
    "notes": "Left at front door",
    "recipient_name": "John Doe",
    "delivered_at": "2025-10-29T10:30:00Z",
    "drivers": {
      "name": "Driver Name",
      "phone": "555-1234"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**delivery_proof table:**

- Drivers can insert their own PoD
- Drivers can view their own PoD
- Customers can view PoD for their orders
- Dispatchers and admins can view all PoD

**Storage (proof-of-delivery bucket):**

- Drivers can upload files to their own folder
- Authenticated users can view files (access controlled via signed URLs)
- Drivers can update/delete their own files

### Storage Structure

Files are organized by driver and order:

```
proof-of-delivery/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {driverId}/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {orderId}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo_{timestamp}_0.jpg
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo_{timestamp}_1.jpg
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo_{timestamp}_2.jpg
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ signature_{timestamp}.png
```

## Configuration

### Image Compression

Default settings in `lib/proof-of-delivery/capture.ts`:

```typescript
const maxWidth = 1920; // Maximum photo width in pixels
const quality = 0.85; // JPEG quality (0-1)
```

Modify these values to adjust file size vs. quality tradeoff.

### Storage Limits

Default limits in `lib/proof-of-delivery/storage.ts`:

```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB per file
const MAX_PHOTOS = 3; // Maximum photos per delivery
```

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes

**Camera Doesn't Work**

Problem: "Failed to access camera" error

Solutions:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on HTTPS
‚úÖ https://yourdomain.com  # Works
‚ùå http://yourdomain.com   # Camera blocked

# 2. Check browser permissions
# Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Allow

# 3. Use file upload as fallback
# Click "Upload Photo" instead of "Start Camera"
```

**Photos Don't Upload**

Problem: Upload fails or times out

Solutions:

1. Check bucket exists: `proof-of-delivery`
2. Verify bucket is set to **Private** (not public)
3. Check browser console for specific error
4. Ensure photos are under 5MB each

**Database Error**

Problem: "Failed to save PoD metadata"

Solutions:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
SELECT * FROM delivery_proof LIMIT 1;

-- If table doesn't exist, run migration:
-- Copy contents of supabase/migrations/005_add_proof_of_delivery.sql
```

### Detailed Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

**Issue**: "Failed to access camera" error

**Solutions**:

1. Check browser permissions (Allow camera access)
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (cameras require secure context)
3. Try fallback: Click "Upload Photo" instead
4. Check browser console for detailed error

### Photos Not Uploading

**Issue**: Photos fail to upload to storage

**Solutions**:

1. Verify storage bucket exists: `proof-of-delivery`
2. Check RLS policies are correctly applied
3. Verify file size is under 5MB
4. Check browser console for API errors

### Signature Not Saving

**Issue**: Signature doesn't convert to blob

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure canvas has content (not blank)
2. Check browser console for canvas errors
3. Try drawing signature again
4. Verify SignaturePad component is mounted

### Database Errors

**Issue**: Failed to save PoD metadata

**Solutions**:

1. Run migration: `supabase/migrations/005_add_proof_of_delivery.sql`
2. Verify table `delivery_proof` exists
3. Check foreign key constraints (order_id, driver_id)
4. Ensure driver has permission to insert

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Photo Capture**:
   - Navigate to `/driver`
   - Select a driver (demo mode)
   - Find an "In Transit" order
   - Click "Mark Delivered"
   - Test camera functionality

3. **Test Signature**:
   - Switch to "Signature" tab
   - Draw with mouse/touch
   - Verify signature displays correctly

4. **Test Submission**:
   - Fill recipient name
   - Add optional notes
   - Submit PoD
   - Verify order status updates to "Delivered"

5. **Test Viewing**:
   - Navigate to customer dashboard
   - View delivered order
   - Verify photos and signature display

### Mobile Testing

Test on actual mobile devices:

1. Deploy to staging/production (HTTPS required for camera)
2. Access on mobile device
3. Test camera access (front/back cameras)
4. Test touch-based signature drawing
5. Verify image compression on mobile

### HubSpot Integration Testing

1. Complete a delivery with PoD
2. Check HubSpot deal for order
3. Verify deal stage updated to "Delivered"
4. Check custom fields for PoD URLs (if configured)

## Best Practices

### For Drivers

1. **Good Lighting**: Take photos in well-lit areas
2. **Clear Photos**: Ensure package is clearly visible
3. **Multiple Angles**: Use all 3 photo slots for different angles
4. **Signature Clarity**: Ask recipient to sign clearly
5. **Accurate Notes**: Add specific delivery location details

### For Implementation

1. **Monitor Storage**: Set up alerts for storage usage
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old PoD data (>1 year)
3. **Compression Testing**: Validate image quality vs. size
4. **Error Logging**: Monitor API errors in production
5. **User Feedback**: Collect driver feedback on usability

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Video proof of delivery (15-30 second clips)
- [ ] GPS coordinates embedded in photos
