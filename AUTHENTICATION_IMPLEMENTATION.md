## Authentication Flows

### Flow 1: Email/Password Sign Up
1. User visits role-specific signup page (customer/driver/dispatcher)
2. Fills in form with email, password, and role-specific info
3. Account created with specified role in `users` table
4. Driver records created automatically for driver signups
5. Email verification sent
6. Redirects to sign-in page

### Flow 2: Email/Password Sign In
1. User visits `/auth/sign-in`
2. Selects their role from dropdown
3. Toggles to "Password" mode
4. Enters email and password
5. Signs in and redirects to role-appropriate dashboard

### Flow 3: Magic Link Sign In
1. User visits `/auth/sign-in`
2. Selects their role from dropdown
3. Keeps "Magic Link" mode selected
4. Enters email
5. Receives magic link via email
6. Clicks link and redirects to role-appropriate dashboard

### Flow 4: Social OAuth (First Time)
1. User clicks Google/Facebook button on sign-in or signup page
2. Completes OAuth flow with provider
3. Redirects to `/auth/oauth-role-select`
4. Selects their role (Customer/Driver/Dispatcher)
5. Role saved to database
6. Redirects to role-appropriate dashboard

### Flow 5: Social OAuth (Returning User)
1. User clicks Google/Facebook button
2. System detects existing role
3. Directly redirects to appropriate dashboard

## Role-Based Redirects

After successful authentication:
- **Customer (recipient):** → `/customer/dashboard`
- **Driver:** → `/driver`
- **Dispatcher:** → `/dispatcher`
- **Admin:** → `/dispatcher` (or `/admin` if admin-only routes exist)

## Supabase Configuration Required

### 1. Enable Authentication Providers
Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers:

#### Email Provider
- Enable "Email" provider
- Enable "Confirm email" if desired
- Configure email templates

#### Google OAuth
1. Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable "Google" provider in Supabase
3. Add Client ID and Secret
4. Add authorized redirect URI: `https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

#### Facebook OAuth
1. Create Facebook App in Meta Developer Portal
2. Enable "Facebook" provider in Supabase
3. Add App ID and Secret
4. Add OAuth Redirect URI: `https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 2. Site URL Configuration
Settings → API:
- **Site URL:** Set to your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- **Redirect URLs:** Add:
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (development)
  - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback` (production)

### 3. Email Templates
Configure templates for:
- Confirm signup
- Magic link
- Password reset

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Google Maps
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key

# Site URL (important for OAuth redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing Checklist

### Customer Authentication
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Sign up with Google OAuth
- [ ] Sign up with Facebook OAuth
- [ ] Sign in with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with magic link
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/customer/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify middleware protection

### Driver Authentication
- [ ] Sign up with email/password (with vehicle info)
- [ ] Sign up with Google OAuth → role selection
- [ ] Sign up with Facebook OAuth → role selection
- [ ] Sign in with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with magic link
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/driver`
- [ ] Verify driver record created in database
- [ ] Verify middleware protection

### Dispatcher Authentication
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Sign up with Google OAuth → role selection
- [ ] Sign up with Facebook OAuth → role selection
- [ ] Sign in with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with magic link
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/dispatcher`
- [ ] Verify middleware protection

### OAuth Role Selection
- [ ] First-time OAuth user redirected to role selection
- [ ] Can select Customer role → redirects to customer dashboard
- [ ] Can select Driver role → creates driver record → redirects to driver dashboard
- [ ] Can select Dispatcher role → redirects to dispatcher dashboard
- [ ] Returning OAuth user bypasses role selection

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [ ] Google Maps API error shows helpful message
- [ ] OAuth errors redirect gracefully
- [ ] Network errors handled appropriately

## Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  auth_id uuid UNIQUE REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email text UNIQUE,
  role user_role, -- 'admin', 'dispatcher', 'driver', 'recipient'
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

The system creates records in this table for all authenticated users with their appropriate roles.

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS):** All tables have RLS policies enabled
2. **Role Verification:** Middleware checks role before granting access
3. **Service Role:** Used only for system operations (user creation, linking)
4. **Password Requirements:** Minimum 6 characters enforced
5. **Email Verification:** Can be enabled in Supabase settings
6. **OAuth Security:** Handled by Supabase Auth with secure redirects

## Known Limitations

1. **Dispatcher Approval:** Currently dispatchers can self-register. Consider adding admin approval workflow.
2. **Role Changes:** Users cannot change their own role. Must contact admin.
3. **Driver Vehicle Info:** Required during signup but can be added later via OAuth flow.
4. **Social Profile Pictures:** Not currently imported from OAuth providers.

## Next Steps

1. **Test all authentication flows** in development environment
2. **Configure OAuth providers** in Supabase Dashboard
3. **Set up email templates** in Supabase
4. **Test in production** with real OAuth credentials
5. **Monitor authentication logs** in Supabase Dashboard
6. **Consider adding** password reset functionality
7. **Consider adding** profile update pages for users to edit their info

## Support

For issues with:
- **Google Maps:** Check API key and Places API enabled
- **OAuth:** Verify redirect URLs in provider settings
- **Role issues:** Check `users` table has correct role values
- **Redirects:** Check middleware.ts and auth/callback/route.ts
