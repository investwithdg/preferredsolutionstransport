## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 🔧 **Environment & Configuration**
- **Enhanced Environment Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for required environment variables with format checking for Stripe keys and URLs
- **Structured Error Handling**: Implemented custom `AppError` class and centralized error handling utilities
- **Configuration Improvements**: Better error messages and validation for production deployments

### 🗄️ **Database & Security**
- **Production Migration**: Created `20250922_production_hardening.sql` with:
  - Least-privilege RLS policies for all tables
  - Additional performance indexes
  - Data integrity constraints
  - System health monitoring functions
  - Rate limiting infrastructure
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented role-based access controls with proper separation between service role, authenticated users, and anonymous access
- **Data Integrity**: Added check constraints for business logic validation

### 📊 **Monitoring & Telemetry**
- **Sentry Integration**: Added comprehensive error tracking with:
  - Server-side error capture helpers
  - Feature flag support
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Webhook error tracking
- **Health Check API**: New `/api/health` endpoint providing:
  - Database connectivity status
  - Environment variable validation
  - System performance metrics
  - Component health status

### 🚦 **Rate Limiting**
- **Database-Backed Rate Limiting**: Implemented production-ready rate limiting using PostgreSQL functions
- **API Protection**: Added rate limiting to `/api/quote` and `/api/checkout` endpoints
- **Configurable Limits**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- **Client Identification**: Proper IP-based rate limiting with fallback handling

### 🧪 **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Comprehensive Smoke Tests**: Created `scripts/smoke.sh` with automated testing for:
  - Health endpoint validation
  - Quote creation workflow
  - Checkout session generation
  - Rate limiting verification
  - Input validation testing
- **Weekly Health Checklist**: `CHECKS.md` with detailed maintenance procedures
- **RLS Security Audit**: `RLS-AUDIT.md` with comprehensive security policy recommendations

### 📈 **Performance & Reliability**
- **Webhook Improvements**: Enhanced idempotency handling and error recovery
- **API Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Database Optimization**: Added strategic indexes for common query patterns
- **Resource Monitoring**: Built-in functions for system health metrics
