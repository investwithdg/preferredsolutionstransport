5. **Run development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. **Test with master users**
   - Admin: `admin@test.preferredsolutions`
   - Dispatcher: `dispatcher@test.preferredsolutions`
   - Driver: `driver@test.preferredsolutions`
   - Customer: `customer@test.preferredsolutions`

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Copy the environment template and configure your services:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

**Critical Environment Variables:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Required for quote form AND live tracking maps
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Database connection
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Server-side database operations
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Payment processing
- `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` - CRM integration + email notifications
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your app URL (for email tracking links, default: http://localhost:3000)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` - Optional SMS alerts for drivers (use Messaging Service SID instead of `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` if preferred)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` - Enable demo UI (role switcher, demo data). Keep false in production

**NEW for Phase 1-3:**

- Google Maps now requires **Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API, and Geometry Library** enabled
- HubSpot token needs transactional email scope for notifications
- Database migration required: run `supabase/migrations/001_add_driver_locations.sql`

### 2. Database Setup

**Run the consolidated schema in Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/consolidated-schema.sql`
3. Paste and execute in the SQL Editor
4. Verify success - you should see "COMPLETE SCHEMA DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!"

This single file contains:

- All tables (customers, quotes, orders, drivers, dispatch_events, webhook_events, users)
- Row Level Security policies for all user roles
- Production-ready indexes and constraints
- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Monitoring functions
- Test data seeding (5 demo drivers)

**Optional: Set up user roles after creating auth users:**

1. Create users in Supabase Auth ‚Üí Users
2. Update emails in `supabase/seeds/initial_roles.sql`
3. Run the seed file to assign roles and link driver/customer records

### 3. Stripe Webhook Setup

**Local development:**

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
# Copy the webhook signing secret to STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env.local
```

**Production:** Create webhook in Stripe Dashboard pointing to your domain's `/api/stripe/webhook` endpoint.

### 4. Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Demo Mode

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env.local` to enable demo features:

- Floating role switcher
- Demo drivers and demo dispatcher data
- Middleware bypasses auth in demo via `demo-mode` cookie
- Test dispatcher workflow without authentication

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for Vercel**: After setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` in environment variables, you MUST redeploy to rebuild the app. The demo mode check is now runtime-based but requires the components to be bundled.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security**: In production, leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` unset/false to disable all demo surfaces.

### Validation & Quality Checks

This project has **automated validation** to prevent deployment failures:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Combined validation (runs before build automatically)
npm run validate

# Full build with validation
npm run build

# Additional code quality checks
npm run depcheck
npm run tsprune
npm run analyze
```

**üîí Automated Pre-deployment Checks:**

- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks run on staged files (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- ‚úÖ Pre-push hooks run full validation before pushing
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI validates all pushes/PRs
- ‚úÖ Vercel build includes prebuild validation

**Validation Pipeline:**

```
Developer writes code
       ‚Üì
[PRE-COMMIT] ‚Üí ESLint + TypeScript + Prettier on staged files
       ‚Üì
[PRE-PUSH] ‚Üí Full typecheck + lint
       ‚Üì
[GITHUB CI] ‚Üí Parallel: Lint | TypeCheck | Build
       ‚Üì
[VERCEL] ‚Üí Clean install + prebuild validation + build
```

**Emergency bypass** (not recommended): Use `--no-verify` flag with git commands.

## üß™ Testing the Complete Flow

Use the script in `scripts/test-api.sh` or test manually:

1.  Go to `/quote`, submit a request, then click Continue to Payment
2.  Complete Stripe test checkout (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3.  Return to `/thank-you`
4.  Visit `/dispatcher` and you should see a new order with `ReadyForDispatch`
5.  Assign an available driver to the order
6.  Visit `/driver`, select the assigned driver from the demo dropdown
7.  Verify you can see the assigned order and update its status
8.  In your Stripe CLI window, you should see `checkout.session.completed`

## üí∞ Pricing Configuration

Pricing currently in `lib/config.ts`:

- Base fee: $50.00
- Per mile: $2.00
- Fuel surcharge: 10% of subtotal

## üóÉ Database Schema

Core tables: `customers`, `quotes`, `orders`, `dispatch_events`, `webhook_events`, `drivers`.

- `customers.email` has a unique constraint to support upserts
- `dispatch_events` is append-only and idempotent via `(source, event_id)`
- Order status transitions are validated via triggers
- `drivers.user_id` is nullable to support creating drivers before full auth integration

## üîå API Routes

- `POST /api/quote` ‚Üí creates customer + quote with pricing
- `POST /api/checkout` ‚Üí creates Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` ‚Üí verifies event, creates order, logs dispatch event, syncs to HubSpot (optional)
- `GET, POST /api/drivers` ‚Üí manage drivers
- `POST /api/orders/assign` ‚Üí assigns a driver to an order
- `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/status` ‚Üí updates order status

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel

### Prerequisites

- All third-party services configured (Supabase, Stripe, HubSpot, Google Maps)
- Code pushed to GitHub
- Vercel account (free tier works)

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Import to Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository
2. **Add Environment Variables**: Copy ALL variables from `.env.local` to Vercel dashboard
   - **Critical**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (app appears blank without this)
   - **Critical**: All Supabase keys
   - **Critical**: All Stripe keys
   - **Recommended**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
3. **Deploy**: Vercel auto-builds and deploys
4. **Update Stripe Webhook**: Point to your production URL `/api/stripe/webhook`
5. **Test**: Verify `/api/health` shows all systems connected

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**App appears blank on Vercel:**

- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - quote page waits for Google Maps to load

**Build failures:**

- TypeScript errors - run `npm run build` locally to test
- Missing environment variables during build

**Runtime errors:**

- Check Vercel Function logs in dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Test API endpoints individually (`/api/health`, `/api/quote`)

**Stripe webhook failures:**

- Webhook URL must match your production domain
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must match the webhook endpoint secret

## üîí Security & Role-Based Access Control

### User Roles

- **ANONYMOUS** - Public users (quote requests only)
- **RECIPIENT** - Authenticated customers (view own orders/tracking)
- **DRIVER** - Delivery drivers (manage assigned orders, update status)
- **DISPATCHER** - Operations staff (full order management, driver assignment)
- **ADMIN** - System administrators (full access, user management)
- **SERVICE_ROLE** - Backend API operations (full database access)

### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) with role-based policies for all tables
- Service role key for secure server-side operations (never exposed to client)
- Webhook signature verification
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Audit logging for all operations
