## âš¡ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Copy the environment template to create your local configuration:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Fill in your **actual** environment variables in `.env.local`.

### 2. Database Setup (Consolidated)

Run the single consolidated schema file in your Supabase SQL editor:

- Open `supabase/schema.sql`
- Copy all contents and run it in Supabase SQL Editor
- This file includes both the base schema and all hardening/guard functions (no separate migration file is needed)
- If rerun, duplicate object warnings are safe to ignore

### 3. Stripe Webhook Setup

For local development:
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI and forward events
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
# Copy the webhook signing secret to STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env.local
```

For production, add your webhook in the Stripe Dashboard and set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

### 4. Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Complete Flow

Use the script in `scripts/test-api.sh` or test manually:

1. Go to `/quote`, submit a request, then click Continue to Payment
2. Complete Stripe test checkout (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. Return to `/thank-you`
4. Visit `/dispatcher` and you should see a new order with `ReadyForDispatch`
5. In your Stripe CLI window, you should see `checkout.session.completed`

## ðŸ’° Pricing Configuration

Pricing currently in `lib/config.ts`:
- Base fee: $50.00
- Per mile: $2.00
- Fuel surcharge: 10% of subtotal

## ðŸ—ƒ Database Schema

Core tables: `customers`, `quotes`, `orders`, `dispatch_events`, `webhook_events`.

- `customers.email` has a unique constraint to support upserts
- `dispatch_events` is append-only and idempotent via `(source, event_id)`
- Order status transitions are validated via triggers

## ðŸ”Œ API Routes

- `POST /api/quote` â†’ creates customer + quote with pricing
- `POST /api/checkout` â†’ creates Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` â†’ verifies event, creates order, logs dispatch event, syncs to HubSpot (optional)

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Set all environment variables in your hosting provider and deploy. `VERCEL_URL` is auto-set on Vercel.

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

- RLS enabled with permissive policies for M1
- Service role key used for secure server-side operations
- Webhook signature verification
- Input validation with Zod

## ðŸ—º Roadmap

- M2: Driver management & actions
- M3: Real-time tracking, Google Maps, notifications
- M4: Admin analytics & reporting
