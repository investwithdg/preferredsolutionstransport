## API Testing

### Using the Test Script

Run the included API test script:

```bash
bash scripts/test-api.sh
```

This tests the complete flow: quote → checkout → webhook → order creation

### Manual API Testing

Use the following curl commands (replace `$API_URL` with your local/deployment URL):

#### 1. Create Quote

```bash
curl -X POST $API_URL/api/quote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
    "customerName": "Test User",
    "customerPhone": "(555) 123-4567",
    "pickupAddress": "123 Main St, New York, NY",
    "dropoffAddress": "456 Broadway, New York, NY",
    "distanceMi": 5.2,
    "weightLb": 50
  }'
```

#### 2. Create Checkout Session

```bash
curl -X POST $API_URL/api/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "quoteId": "QUOTE_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
  }'
```

#### 3. Assign Driver (requires auth)

```bash
curl -X POST $API_URL/api/orders/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{
    "orderId": "ORDER_ID",
    "driverId": "DRIVER_ID"
  }'
```

   - Arrive at destination
   - Capture proof of delivery:
     - Take signature
     - Upload photos
     - Add delivery notes

   - Click on completed order
   - See proof of delivery
   - View photos and signature

### Multi-Tenant Testing

**Test tenant isolation:**

1. Create multiple test customers
2. Place orders from each
3. Log in as each customer
4. Verify they only see their own orders
5. Verify drivers only see assigned orders
6. Verify dispatchers see all orders

---

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Order not appearing in dispatcher queue"

**Possible Causes:**

- Order status is not "ReadyForDispatch"
- Realtime subscription not connected
- RLS policy blocking access

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Check order status
SELECT id, status FROM orders WHERE id = 'ORDER_ID';

-- Manually set to ReadyForDispatch
UPDATE orders SET status = 'ReadyForDispatch' WHERE id = 'ORDER_ID';
```

### Issue: "HubSpot sync failing"

**Check:**

1. `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` is set
2. Token has correct scopes (contacts, deals)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. View response in Network tab

**Test HubSpot API manually:**

```bash
curl https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Issue: "Payment not recording"

**Check:**

1. Stripe webhook is configured and delivered
2. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches webhook secret
3. Check `/api/admin/logs` for webhook events
4. Verify Stripe CLI is running (local dev)

**Stripe CLI Command:**

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

### Issue: "Driver location not updating"

**Check:**

1. Driver has granted location permissions
2. Location update API is being called
3. Check `driver_locations` table in database
4. Verify realtime subscriptions connected

**Manual Location Update:**

```sql
UPDATE driver_locations
SET latitude = 40.7580, longitude = -73.9855, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE driver_id = 'DRIVER_ID';
```

### Issue: "Test data not appearing"

**Solution:**

1. Verify you ran `complete_test_data.sql`
2. Check auth users were created first
3. Confirm emails match exactly: `role@test.preferredsolutions`
4. Re-run seed script if needed

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with 100+ orders in dispatch queue
- [ ] Test with 50+ drivers on map
- [ ] Test real-time updates with multiple browser windows
- [ ] Test concurrent order assignments
- [ ] Monitor database query performance

### Tools

- **Database queries:** Use Supabase Dashboard → Logs → Postgres
- **API performance:** Check Vercel Analytics
- **Frontend performance:** Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse

---

## Security Testing

### Authentication Testing

- [ ] Verify unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes
- [ ] Test role-based access control
  - [ ] Customer cannot access `/dispatcher`
  - [ ] Driver cannot access `/admin`
  - [ ] Dispatcher cannot access admin-only features
- [ ] Test session expiration and renewal

### Data Privacy Testing

- [ ] Customer A cannot see Customer B's orders
- [ ] Driver cannot see unassigned orders' customer details
- [ ] RLS policies enforce data isolation

---

## Regression Testing

After making changes, always test:

1. **Quote → Payment → Order** flow still works
2. **Order Assignment** still functions
3. **Real-time updates** still trigger
4. **HubSpot sync** still executes
5. **Payment history** still loads

---

## Test Data Management

### Reset Test Data

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
DELETE FROM driver_locations WHERE driver_id::text LIKE '00000000%';
DELETE FROM dispatch_events WHERE source = 'test_seed';
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id::text LIKE '00000000%';
DELETE FROM quotes WHERE id::text LIKE '00000000%';
```

Then re-run `supabase/seeds/complete_test_data.sql`

### Create Additional Test Data

Add to `complete_test_data.sql` or create manually:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (id, customer_id, price_total, status, ...)
VALUES (...);
```

---

## Automated Testing (Future)

**Recommended test frameworks:**

- **Unit tests:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration tests:** Supertest for APIs
- **E2E tests:** Playwright or Cypress
- **Database tests:** PostgreSQL TAP

**Test coverage priorities:**

1. Authentication flows
2. Order lifecycle
3. Payment processing
4. HubSpot sync
5. Real-time subscriptions

---

## CI/CD Testing

The GitHub Action `.github/workflows/validate-deps.yml` runs on every PR to ensure:

- Dependencies are in sync
- No security vulnerabilities
- Lock file is valid

---

## Monitoring in Production

### Health Checks

Monitor these endpoints:

- `/api/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/admin/health` - Detailed system status (admin only)
- `/api/admin/health/integrations` - Integration status
- `/api/admin/health/database` - Database metrics

### Logging

- **Dispatch Events:** All logged to `dispatch_events` table
- **Audit Logs:** User actions logged to `audit_logs` table (after migration)
- **Webhook Events:** Logged to `webhook_events` and `hubspot_webhook_events`

### Alerts (Recommended)

Set up alerts for:

- Failed HubSpot syncs
- Failed payment intents
- Unassigned orders > 1 hour old
- Driver location not updating > 30 minutes
- API error rate > 5%

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always test in demo mode first** before using real integrations
2. **Use test Stripe cards** - never use real payment methods
3. **Keep test data clearly labeled** with `@test.preferredsolutions` domain
4. **Reset test data regularly** to ensure clean state
5. **Document any issues** you encounter for future reference
