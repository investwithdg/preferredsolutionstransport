# Dispatcher Portal Enhancements

This document describes the newly implemented features for the dispatcher portal.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Push Notifications for Drivers

Drivers can now receive instant push notifications when they are assigned a new delivery order.

#### How it works:
1. **Enable Notifications**: In the driver dashboard, drivers can enable push notifications by clicking the "Enable" button in the Push Notifications card.
2. **Permission Request**: The browser will ask for permission to send notifications.
3. **Automatic Alerts**: When a dispatcher assigns an order to a driver, they will receive a push notification with order details.

#### Setup Requirements:
- VAPID keys must be generated and added to your `.env.local` file:
  ```bash
  node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.js
  ```
- Add the generated keys to `.env.local`:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="your-public-key"
  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
  ```
- Run the database migration to add push subscription support:
  ```sql
  -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
  ALTER TABLE drivers
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS push_subscription jsonb DEFAULT NULL;
  ```

### 2. Map View for Order Routes

Dispatchers can now visualize order routes on an interactive Google Maps view.

#### How it works:
1. **View Map**: Click the map icon button next to any order in the dispatcher dashboard.
2. **Route Display**: A modal will open showing:
   - Interactive Google Maps view
   - Pickup location (marked with pin)
   - Dropoff location (marked with pin)
   - Driving route between locations
   - Total distance

#### Features:
- Automatic route calculation
- Blue route line showing the driving path
- Distance information in the modal header
- Full address details for pickup and dropoff
