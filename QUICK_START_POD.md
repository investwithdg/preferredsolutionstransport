- [ ] Storage bucket `proof-of-delivery` exists and is private
- [ ] Can access `/driver` page without errors
- [ ] PoD modal opens when clicking "Mark Delivered"
- [ ] Camera permission request appears (on HTTPS)
- [ ] Photo upload alternative works
- [ ] Signature pad draws smoothly
- [ ] Form validation works (recipient name required)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Camera Doesn't Work
**Problem**: "Failed to access camera" error

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on HTTPS
‚úÖ https://yourdomain.com  # Works
‚ùå http://yourdomain.com   # Camera blocked

# 2. Check browser permissions
# Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Allow

# 3. Use file upload as fallback
# Click "Upload Photo" instead of "Start Camera"
```

### Photos Don't Upload
**Problem**: Upload fails or times out

**Solutions**:
1. Check bucket exists: `proof-of-delivery`
2. Verify bucket is set to **Private** (not public)
3. Check browser console for specific error
4. Ensure photos are under 5MB each

### Database Error
**Problem**: "Failed to save PoD metadata"

**Solutions**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
SELECT * FROM delivery_proof LIMIT 1;

-- If table doesn't exist, run migration:
-- Copy contents of supabase/migrations/005_add_proof_of_delivery.sql
```
